Android Studio comes with some inbuilt plugins, but they are not that necessary. Disabling them makes the Studio run faster. So this file contains the list of the disabled plugins. And the paths of the file according to the OS are:
*	Linux - `~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio4.1`
*	Windows - `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Google\AndroidStudioPreview4.1`
